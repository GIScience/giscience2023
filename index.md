# Workshop on Centrality Indicators in Road Network Analysis: from concept to implementation
GIScience Conference, Leeds, UK, September 12, 2023

Centrality indicators are used to identify important nodes or edges in graph networks. Applied to road networks these 
indicators can for example be used to model traffic speed or identify critical roads to support disaster preparedness. 
Still, open challenges remain on how the geographical context of road networks (e.g. road type, spatio-temporal travel 
patterns) should be integrated and how to efficiently calculate centrality indicators for such complex networks. 

This workshop will provide a platform to discuss and learn about centrality indicators both at a conceptual as well as 
a technical implementation level. In addition, hands-on sessions on how to calculate centrality indicators using 
openrouteservice will be offered by the organizers to interested participants. 

### Workshop Format
The workshop will be done in a “open-space” format, where participants themselves suggest topics and decide on the 
agenda. This enables participants to adapt the workshop according to their interests and encourages exchange between 
participants to start new research collaborations. An introduction to the "open space" method will be given at the 
beginning of the workshop. 

**Discussion topics** for the session will be proposed and selected by the participants. Possible topics may be but are 
not limited to:
•	How are centrality indicators applied in the geospatial realm?
•	What are current challenges, limitations or open questions?
•	How can centrality indicators be adapted, improved or extended?
•	Which software packages are available to calculate centrality indicators for road network analysis? What are 
their limitations?
•	What are the software requirements to calculate more advanced and meaningful geospatial centrality indicators?
•	How to get from conceptual research over proof-of-concepts to ready-to use software to support policy makers?

In addition, **practical hands-on sessions** will be offered by organizers for interested participants:
•	What is openrouteservice? How to send API requests
•	How to calculate different centrality measures using openrouteservice
•	How to set up a local docker instance of openrouteservice on your computer

## Registration
Conference attendees interested in participating in the workshop may send an email to christina.ludwig@heigit.org with 
a short paragraph explaining their motivation to participate in the workshop until 30.06.2023. The workshop is limited 
to 20 people.  

Participation in the hands-on tutorials requires participants to bring their own laptop and installing the required 
software prior to the workshop. Installation instructions will be sent out at least two weeks before the conference.

HeiGIT and the GIScience Research Group work closely together with the aim of transferring fundamental research in 
geoinformatics to practical applications. Within this collaboration we have performed road network analyses in the 
context of disaster preparedness (Petricola et al., 2022), pedestrian and bike routing (Ludwig et al., 2021, Hatfield 
et al., 2022) and traffic modelling (Zia et al., 2022). All of these studies used openrouteservice, an open-source 
routing service based on OpenStreetMap data, which is developed and provided as a public service by HeiGIT gGmbH.
